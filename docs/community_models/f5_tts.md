# F5-TTS (community model)

[F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS) is an open-source zero-shot voice-cloning TTS built on a
flow-matching diffusion transformer (DiT) with a ConvNeXt text conditioner and a Vocos vocoder.
This community port also targets the [Habibi-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/Habibi-TTS) finetune —
a multi-dialect Arabic checkpoint suite (MSA, SAU, UAE, ALG, IRQ, EGY, MAR, OMN, TUN, LEV, SDN, LBY)
from the same authors — which uses the identical architecture, giving Arabic support through the
same family (`habibi` / `habibi_tts` are registered as aliases).

**Status: M4 — inference wired end to end.** The session (`src/community_models/f5_tts/session.cpp`)
runs full synthesis via `f5_synthesize` (text pipeline with Habibi dialect tokens → batched-CFG DiT
Euler sampler → Vocos vocoder) and is served by `audiocpp_server`. Parity vs the reference PyTorch
implementation is covered by golden harnesses (DiT stage taps, batched CFG incl. the null branch,
tokenizer ids) plus a whisper.cpp ASR pronunciation check; see `/mnt/ai/f5-parity/run_all.sh`.

## Milestones

Each milestone is gated on parity against the reference PyTorch implementation (cosine similarity
≥ 0.999 on fixed inputs) plus a listening check, matching the evidence bar described in #54 and
PR #180.

| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Family registration, model spec, stub session, this doc | done |
| M1 | Weight loading + mel-Vocos decode path (ConvNeXt + iSTFT) | done (mel-corr 0.9963) |
| M2 | DiT forward (RoPE, adaLN) + ConvNeXt text conditioner | done (all stages cosine 1.000000) |
| M3 | CFM sampler (Euler, sway + EPSS, CFG null-branch parity), inference wiring, En/Ar samples | done |
| M4 | Long-form chunking, RTF/VRAM evidence, server wiring | done (0.51x RTF on RTX 3090; GGUF packages hosted at trklou/audio.cpp) |

## Server usage

`audiocpp_server.json` entry: family `f5_tts`, model path = checkpoint directory (a `*.gguf`
package, or a safetensors checkpoint + `vocab.txt` for development). Session options:
`f5_tts.vocos_path` (only needed with safetensors checkpoints lacking a bundled vocoder),
`f5_tts.dialect` (default UNK), `f5_tts.frame_budget` (mel frames per CFM pass, 0 = 2048).
Requests take `reference_text` (required), `dialect`, `speed`, `seed`, `num_inference_steps`,
`cfg_strength` (alias `guidance_scale`), `sway_sampling_coef`, `strip_diacritics`.

**Diacritics (harakat):** the model DOES read harakat/tanwin/shadda — they are tokens in the
vocab and measurably change pronunciation (minimal pair: حصان → "hassan" vs حِصَان → "hissan",
and shadda produces gemination). What garbled diacritized text in BOTH this port and the Python
reference was the duration estimate: combining marks count as tokens, so fully diacritized text
inflated the duration up to ~2x, and the model filled the excess with stretched/repeated
characters. The frontend now keeps the marks but counts them as zero speech time in the duration
and chunk-sizing math, so `أَيْنَ اللَّوْنُ الأَحْمَر؟` reads as `أين اللون الأحمر؟` and
disambiguating marks take effect. `strip_diacritics=true` force-strips them instead
(escape hatch).

## Quickstart (from a fresh clone)

Everything needed is installable from this repository — no Python inference stack required:

```bash
# 1. Build (f5_tts is included in AUDIOCPP_MODEL_SET=full, or select it explicitly)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DAUDIOCPP_MODEL_SET=custom \
      -DAUDIOCPP_MODELS=f5_tts -DENGINE_ENABLE_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --parallel --target audiocpp_cli audiocpp_server

# 2. Download the model package (GGUF: DiT + Vocos vocoder in one file + vocab.txt)
python3 tools/model_manager_v2.py install habibi_unified
# Per-dialect specialized checkpoints (stronger accent): habibi_alg, habibi_egy,
# habibi_irq, habibi_mar, habibi_msa, habibi_sau, habibi_uae
# Standalone vocoder for the original safetensors checkpoints: vocos_mel_24khz

# 3. Synthesize (zero-shot: any short reference WAV + its transcript)
build/bin/audiocpp_cli --task tts --family habibi \
    --model <models>/Habibi-TTS/Unified \
    --voice-ref /path/to/reference.wav \
    --reference-text 'transcript of the reference audio' \
    --text 'أهلا، هذا نص عربي تجريبي.' \
    --request-option dialect=UNK --out out.wav
```

The GGUF package is self-contained: the DiT lives under the `transformer` namespace and the
Vocos vocoder under `vocos`, so no separate vocoder download or `f5_tts.vocos_path` option is
needed (the option and safetensors fallbacks still work for the original HF checkpoints).
Dialects: `UNK MSA SAU UAE ALG IRQ EGY MAR OMN TUN LEV SDN LBY`.
Reference audio longer than ~10.9s is truncated (with a warning) — keep refs under that
and make sure the transcript matches, otherwise the transcript tail leaks into the output.

### Converting checkpoints to GGUF

`tools/convert_f5_tts.py` wraps `audiocpp_gguf` and produces one self-contained GGUF per
checkpoint (`transformer` + `vocos` namespaces) plus the standalone vocoder package:

```bash
python3 tools/convert_f5_tts.py --checkpoint-root /models/Habibi-TTS \
    --vocos /models/vocos-mel-24khz/vocos.safetensors \
    --converter build/bin/audiocpp_gguf --output-dir gguf-packages
```

The safetensors source layout stays supported for development; the packaged/default format is GGUF.
